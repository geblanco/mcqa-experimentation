ToDo :=
- Check difference between no empty answers and empty answers removed
- Fix training program to accept param files, inheritance of params?... Having repeated keys would avoid inheritance. 
- Unify evaluation stages (bert-eval-noea-std-quail)
- Params extraction from file in extract_embeddings (do by specific params.yaml)
- Extract embeddings: where does data come frome? State as arg
- Separate things by stages and use wdir.
- Use a better model, ALBERT-v2-xlarge,xxlarge produce among the best results on RACE.
